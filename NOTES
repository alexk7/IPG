1) use memory-mapped file
	- don't allocate any std::string for node content since we reuse the original mapped memory
	- that also mean we don't need to "unique" strings, in fact it's better to keep things local

2) memoize choice alternative when necessary lookahead is
	- more than 1 ?
	- may pass through another node ? => that respect the restriction not to execution actions on backtracked alternatives, but probably inefficient
	
3) replace use of null pointer by boolean return value
